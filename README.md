Rebrauned
==================

The Drupal theme running [http://bryanbraun.com](bryanbraun.com), for Drupal 7.

Built on a heavily modified [http://drupalgardens.com](Drupal Gardens) theme.

I almost didn't share it because the code is a bit messy. Regardless, it does the job.

I won't be dedicating a lot of my spare cycles to maintain the project publicly, but if I make any improvements to my site, I'll push up the changes.
