Rebrauned
==================

The Drupal theme running [bryanbraun.com](http://bryanbraun.com).

Built on a heavily modified [Drupal Gardens](http://drupalgardens.com) theme.

I almost didn't share it because the code is a bit messy. Regardless, it does the job.

I won't be dedicating a lot of time to maintain the project publicly, but if I make any improvements to my site, I'll push up the changes.
